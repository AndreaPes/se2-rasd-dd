# RASD & DD
Politecnico di Milano — Software Engineering 2 — _AY 2024–2025_

## About
The goal of this project was to conceive, analyze, and design _Students & Companies (S&C)_, a platform that matches students with internship opportunities.

Deliverables:
- **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document**
- **Design Document**

## Goal and requirements
- Provision of information by companies and students (internships, CVs, etc.).
- Management of the selection process, assuming students identify interesting companies manually by proactively querying S&C.
- Monitoring of internship execution, including the collection of complaints.
- Collection of statistics and of feedback.
- Recommendation mechanisms.
- Suggestions to improve project descriptions and CVs.
- Handling of complaints by the universities.

## Key learnings
- **Requirements fundamentals:** write verifiable functional/non-functional requirements with clear IDs.
- **Goals & domain assumptions:** capture intent and context early; make assumptions explicit.
- **RASD workflow:** stakeholders → goals → scenarios → requirements → constraints.
- **DD workflow:** derive architecture, components, interfaces, data, and behavior from the RASD and quality drivers.
- **UML proficiency:** use the UML language (use case, activity, sequence, state, component) to communicate unambiguously.
- **Traceability:** maintain links from goals → requirements → design → verification.
- **Quality attributes:** let performance, reliability, security/privacy, and modifiability guide design choices.
- **System boundaries & interfaces:** define what’s inside/outside; specify contracts and responsibilities.
- **Behavioral validation:** use scenarios and diagrams to surface edge cases early.
- **Team collaboration:** division of work, reviews and shared style.
