\section{Purpose}
As internships become a fundamental part of academic and professional careers, providing students with easier access to opportunities is more important than ever. Traditionally, internship management has relied on fragmented systems, where students struggle to find opportunities, companies face difficulties in attracting the right candidates, and universities have limited visibility into the process.

The Student\&Company (S\&C) Platform aims to bridge these gaps. It provides a centralized system where students can explore internships, enhance their CVs, and apply with ease. Companies benefit by gaining access to tools to improve their internship postings and efficiently manage applications.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To simplify and enhance the internship application process for students.
    \item To support companies in attracting and selecting top talent.
    \item To empower universities to oversee and manage complaints effectively.
    \item To foster transparent and effective communication among all stakeholders.
\end{enumerate}

This platform is designed to create a more equitable, efficient, and user-friendly experience for students, companies, and universities, ensuring a collaborative and successful internship process.
